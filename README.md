4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

# Usage
* Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing and model training.
* Once models are trained, they can be saved in the "models" directory.
* Use the provided scripts or create your own interface for making predictions using the trained models.
* 
# Future Improvements
* Incorporate more advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods and deep learning architectures.
